			<h1> The Infinite Product Form of the Generating Function of the Integer Partition Function </h1>
			Note that 
			$$
			\begin{align*}
			5 &= 5 \\
			&= 4+1 \\
			&= 3+2 \\
			&= 3+1+1 \\
			&= 2+2+1 \\
			&= 2+1+1+1 \\ 
			&= 1+1+1+1+1.
			\end{align*}
			$$
			Each of these sum representations of \(5\) is called a partition of \(5\).
			The order of the summands does not matter. All that matters is the quantity of each type (the number itself, like \(1\) or \(2\)) of summand. 
			We say that \(p(5) = 7\), where \(p\) is called the Integer Partition Function. 

			<p> 
			Define the generating function of \(p\) as \(F(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}p(n)x^n\). Though the generating function is a (symbolic) infinite sum, it also has an infinite product representation.
			Our goal is to show that \(F(x) = \prod_{n=0}^{\infty}(1-x^n)^{-1}\). We proceed by working backwards from the product reprentation, doing some algebraic manipulations:
			$$
			\begin{align}
			F(x) &= \prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-x^n)^{-1}	\\
			&= \prod_{n=1}^{\infty}\left((1-x)\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x^i\right)^{-1} \\
			&= \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}x^j}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x^i} \\
			&= \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x^{ni}
			\end{align}
			$$
			Let's break down these algebraic steps. 
			<ol>
				<li>From \((1)\) to \((2)\) we factored the polynomial \(1-x^n\). </li>
				<li>From \((2)\) to \((3)\) we expanded \((1-x)^{-1}\) into its infinite series expansion, \(\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}x^j = 1+x+x^2+x^3+\dots\) </li>
				<li>From \((3)\) to \((4)\) is a little tricky. The product term when \(n=1\) is simple (just \(\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}x^j\)), so let's look at the \(n=2\) term. 
					For \(n=2\), we have that the product term is \(\frac{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}x^j}{1+x}\). Let's try to evaluate this quotient and see what happens:
					$$
					\begin{align*}
					\frac{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}x^j}{1+x} &= \frac{1+x+x^2+x^3+\dots}{1+x} \\
					&= \frac{1+x}{1+x} + \frac{x^2+x^3}{1+x} + \dots \\
					&= 1 + x^2 + \dots.
					\end{align*}
					$$
					Thus, we see the product term for \(n=2\) is \(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x^{2i}\), so in general the product term is \(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x^{ni}\).
			</ol>
			Now let's try to figure out what the coefficients of the series of line \((4)\) are, now that we've gotten rid of all of the annoying fractions. 
			Expanded, it looks like this:
			$$
			(1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5+\dots)(1+x^2+x^4+\dots)(1+x^3+\dots)(1+x^4+\dots)(1+x^5+\dots)\dots
			$$
			Let's focus on a particular degree. What is the coefficient of \(x^5\)?
			Here are the cases for how we can get \(x^5\) by multiplying the product terms:
			<ol>
				<li> We choose \(x^5\) from the \(n=5\) product term, and \(1\) from all the other product terms. </li>
				<li> We choose \(x^4\) from the \(n=4\) product term, \(x\) from the \(n=1\) product term, and \(1\) from all the other product terms. </li>
				<li> We choose \(x^3\) from the \(n=3\) product term, \(x^2\) from the \(n=2\) product term, and \(1\) from all the other product terms. </li>
				<li> We choose \(x^3\) from the \(n=3\) product term, \(x^2\) from the \(n=1\) product term, and \(1\) from all the other product terms. </li>
				<li> We choose \(x^4\) from the \(n=2\) product term, \(x\) from the \(n=1\) product term, and \(1\) from all the other product terms. </li> 
				<li> We choose \(x^2\) from the \(n=2\) product term, \(x^3\) from the \(n=1\) product term, and \(1\) from all the other product terms. </li>
				<li> We choose \(x^5\) from the \(n=1\) product term, and \(1\) from all the other product terms. </li>
			</ol>
			Does this seem familiar? It should, because there's a one-to-one correspondence between the above list and the decomposition of \(5\) into partitions that we started with at the top of this post. 
			More explicitly, if we chose \(x^d\) from product term \(n\) to try to make \(x^m\), this corresponds to having \(d/n\) \(n\)'s in our partition sum representation of \(m\).
			This finishes the "proof" that the two forms (infinite sum and infinite product) of the generating function of the integer partition function are equivalent. QED. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Something interesting to note is that the Riemann Zeta Function is a series which has a similar product representation to the partition function, but in terms of the primes (discovered by Euler). I believe this is what first suggested to mathematicians that the Zeta Function would have anything to do with the distribution of the prime numbers. </p>

			A fun related problem: what is the probability that two random large numbers are coprime? </p>
